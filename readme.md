# ENMPY
ENMPY is a Python-based tool for AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism. It is the MathTools equivalent for this course, and solves equations for any variable. This tool will be updated periodically throughout the 25-26 academic year to add more course content to the program. This is because I do not know the content yet and therefore I will add as I learn. 

# Installation
On a computer: 
```python3 enmpy.py```

On the TI 84 Plus CE Python Edition:
Upload ```enmpy.py``` to the calculator. It will only show up in the Python app if loaded into RAM! 

# Integral Calculator
Work in progress, very very broken. Not nearly as good as https://integral-calculator.net which is much more complete.
